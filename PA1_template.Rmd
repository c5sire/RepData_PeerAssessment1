# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")

dat =read.csv("activity.csv")
dat$date <- as.Date(dat$date)

stepsByDay = aggregate(steps ~date, data=dat, sum)
stepsByInt = aggregate(steps ~interval, data=dat, mean)
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
hist(stepsByDay$steps)
```

```{r}
mns = mean(stepsByDay$steps)
mds = median(stepsByDay$steps)
```
The mean total number of steps per day is `r mns`; the median number of steps is `r mds`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Time series plot
```{r }
plot(steps~interval, dat=stepsByInt, type="l")
```

2. Which 5-min interval contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r echo=TRUE}
maxInt= stepsByInt[which(max(stepsByInt[,2])==stepsByInt[,2]),]
```

The maximum number of steps is taken during the interval # `r maxInt[1]`.

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
